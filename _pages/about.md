 <font size="3"> I am a first-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science, University of Toronto, working under the supervision of Dr. Ishtiaque Ahmed. I am passionate about employing Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) to understand and fight the socio-economic problems of the marginalized communities, among which are poverty, unemployment, domestic violence, and different aspects of inequality. As well, I am interested in the interaction of AI and society, AI for social good, and ethics of AI. I am also involved in using computing and web resources to make NGOs more transparent and productive, and the donation process more impactful.\  </font>

 <font size="3">Before joining the department of CS at U of T, I was working in the Rotman Research Institute under the supervision of Dr. Stephen Strother and Dr. Steve Arnott. There, I developed a converter pipeline for the data management system of the Ontario Brain Insititute and converted their extensive MRI imaging database to the new globally defined Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS). I was also a memeber of the data curation team, helping in the development and application of multivariate statistical tools for outlier detection of complex data. \</font>

 <font size="3">I received my master's in Biomedical Engineering from the University of Toronto under the supervision of Dr. Tom Chau. My study focused on investigating the effect of meditation on the oscillations of EEG signals, where I gained my knowledge about machine learning, statistics, and health-related programming skills. Specifically, I evaluated how meditation and mental rehearsal affect the classification accuracy of brain-computer interface (BCI) devices. I received my BS in Electrical Engineering from the University of Tehran, Iran. During my undergraduate years, I had the chance to do a research internship and design a cough detection module to be embedded in a dysphagia detection algorithm.\</font>

 <font size="3">In my spare time, I enjoy meditation, reading books, and being in nature. I also like astronomy and night sky observation.</font>
