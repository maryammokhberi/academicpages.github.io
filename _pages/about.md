 <font size="3"> I am a third-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science, University of Toronto, working under the supervision of Dr. Ishtiaque Ahmed.
My study is about addressing racial injustice in online communities, especially COVID19-related anti-Asian hate speech on Twitter. I am also involved in a project highlighting the immigrants' donation pracices with regards to digital resources. 
Beyond the projects mentioned above, I am passionate about employing computer science and technology to understand and fight the socio-economic problems of the marginalized communities, among which are poverty, unemployment, domestic violence, and different aspects of inequality. I am also interested in the interaction of AI and society, and computational social Sciences.<br />    
  
Before joining the department of CS at U of T, I was working in the Rotman Research Institute under the supervision of Dr. Stephen Strother and Dr. Steve Arnott. I developed a converter pipeline for the data management system of the Ontario Brain Insititute which converted their extensive MRI imaging database to the new globally defined Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS). I was also a member of the data curation team, helping in the development and application of multivariate statistical tools for outlier detection of complex data.<br />    

I received my master's in Biomedical Engineering from the University of Toronto under the supervision of Dr. Tom Chau. My study focused on investigating the effect of meditation on the oscillations of EEG signals, where I gained knowledge about machine learning, statistics, and health-related programming skills. Specifically, I evaluated how meditation and mental rehearsal affect the classification accuracy of brain-computer interface (BCI) devices. I received my BS in Electrical Engineering from the University of Tehran, Iran. During my undergraduate years, I had the chance to do a research internship and design a cough detection module to be embedded in a dysphagia detection algorithm.<br />     

In my spare time, I enjoy meditation, reading books, and being in nature. I also like astronomy and night sky observation.</font>
